## my process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- flexible box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to overlay containers of a lighter color to style the main image

### Continuous development

I would like to apply the BEM methodology more, the constant practice since I do an exercise and continue for days and I consider that it is very bad, so I will not be able to perform well.

### Useful Resources

thanks to my brain
